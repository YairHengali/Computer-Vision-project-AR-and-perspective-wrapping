# Computer Vision project: AR and perspective  wrapping
Project in computer vision course.

"perspective_wrapping.py" is the code that wraps the py_in_forest image on the book captured on the input video - outputs output_video_part1.avi.

"planar_AR.py" is the code that makes the Rabbit statue stand on the book captured on the input video - outputs output_video_part2.avi.
